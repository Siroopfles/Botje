    - Split settings between user and server level
    - MongoDB handles ID generation
    - Notification cooldown system
    - Rate limiting per user and server
    - Automatic cleanup scheduling
    - Default retention periods

2. **Domain Model**
    - Tasks with rich metadata
    - Recurrence patterns
    - Status management
    - User assignments
    - Server isolation
    - Validation schemas
    - Notification preferences per user
    - Server-wide notification settings
    - Multiple notification types
    - User preferences management
    - Server settings management
    - Notification throttling
    - Rate limit configuration
    - Cleanup settings

3. **Technology**
    - MongoDB with Mongoose
    - Discord.js command system
    - TypeScript for type safety
    - Zod for validation
    - ES modules throughout
    - Repository pattern for data access
    - MongoDB native IDs
    - In-memory notification tracking
    - Scheduled cleanup jobs
    - Rate limit counters

## Current Challenges
- Testing notification delivery in different scenarios
- Managing scheduled notifications
- Fine-tuning notification timing
- Managing permissions
- Handling recurring tasks
- User interface improvements
- Monitoring cleanup performance
- Optimizing rate limits

## Next Steps
1. **Task Notifications**
    - ✅ Set up notification types and interfaces
    - ✅ Create notification service
    - ✅ Implement database models and repositories
    - ✅ Add user notification preferences
    - ✅ Add server notification settings
    - ✅ Fix settings update handling
    - ✅ Test settings commands
    - ✅ Implement notification scheduling
    - ✅ Fix duplicate notifications
    - ✅ Add notification cooldown
    - ✅ Add rate limiting
    - ✅ Implement auto cleanup
    - [ ] Test different notification scenarios
    - [ ] Add notification management commands

2. **Permission System**
    - Role-based access control
    - Admin commands
    - User permissions
    - Server settings

3. **Web Dashboard**
    - Setup Next.js project
    - Authentication system
    - Task management UI
    - Real-time updates

4. **Template System**
    - Task templates
    - Recurring task creation
    - Template management
    - Server defaults

## In Progress
- Refining notification delivery system
- Testing notification scenarios
- Error handling improvements
- Settings system validation
- Cleanup performance monitoring
- Rate limit fine-tuning

## Blocked Items
- Complex notifications (pending testing)
- Web dashboard (pending core functionality)
- Advanced templates (pending basic system)

## Notes
- Consider periodic task cleanup
- Plan for scalability
- Document command usage
- Monitor rate limit effectiveness
- Monitor database performance
- Test notification scheduling performance
- Consider notification batching for efficiency
- Keep user and server settings separate
- Document MongoDB ID handling
- Handle boolean settings explicitly
- Validate all settings updates
- Test channel permissions before sending
- Monitor cleanup timing
- Track failed notifications
- Watch memory usage for cooldowns
- Consider backup strategies
