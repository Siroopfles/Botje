# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Task management command implementation
- Database integration
- Environment configuration
- Command deployment system

## Recent Changes
- Created task creation command
- Implemented MongoDB integration
- Added environment variable validation
- Set up database connection handling
- Updated command registration system
- Fixed TypeScript configuration
- Added proper error handling

## Active Decisions
1. **Architecture**
   - Database connection at bot startup
   - Environment variable validation
   - Command-specific error handling
   - Type-safe database operations
   - Shared package integration

2. **Domain Model**
   - Task as core entity
   - Status tracking
   - Assignment system
   - Due date handling
   - Error validation

3. **Technology**
   - MongoDB with Mongoose
   - ES modules throughout
   - Discord.js command system
   - TypeScript for type safety

## Current Challenges
- Managing environment secrets
- Testing database operations
- Command deployment workflow
- User feedback handling

## Next Steps
1. **Additional Commands**
   - List tasks command
   - Edit task command
   - Delete task command
   - Task status updates

2. **Testing Setup**
   - Unit tests for commands
   - Database integration tests
   - Command validation tests
   - Error handling tests

3. **User Experience**
   - Improved error messages
   - Command validation
   - User feedback
   - Help documentation

## In Progress
- Command system expansion
- Database operation testing
- Error handling improvements

## Blocked Items
- Production deployment (pending testing)
- Advanced features (pending basic command completion)
- Web dashboard (pending core functionality)

## Notes
- Keep sensitive data out of repositories
- Document environment setup
- Consider adding command aliases
- Plan for data validation
- Monitor database performance
