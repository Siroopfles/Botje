# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Project initialization and setup phase
- Documentation establishment
- Architecture planning

## Recent Changes
- Created and initialized memory bank structure
- Documented project requirements in projectbrief.md
- Established product context and goals
- Defined system architecture and patterns
- Specified technical stack and development setup

## Active Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**
   - Selected Node.js ecosystem for backend and bot
   - Chosen Next.js for web dashboard
   - MongoDB for database storage
   - TypeScript for type safety

2. **Architecture**
   - Monorepo structure for better code sharing
   - Microservices-style separation between bot and web
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
   - Repository pattern for data access

## Current Challenges
- Setting up development environment
- Implementing initial project structure
- Establishing coding standards
- Creating basic bot functionality

## Next Steps
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize monorepo structure
   - Set up basic Discord bot
   - Create initial web dashboard
   - Configure MongoDB database

2. **Core Development**
   - Implement basic command structure
   - Create database schemas
   - Set up authentication system
   - Develop task management core

3. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation
   - Write setup instructions
   - Document development workflows
   - Establish contribution guidelines

## In Progress
- Memory bank initialization
- Project structure planning
- Development environment setup

## Blocked Items
- Hosting setup (pending provider decision)
- Monitoring implementation (pending tool selection)
- Production deployment (pending initial development)

## Notes
- Focus on establishing strong foundation
- Ensure thorough documentation from start
- Maintain type safety throughout development
- Consider scalability in initial design
